# Challenge: Count words in a body of text
#### Time alotted: 30 minutes

### Scenario
I want to count the times a specific word, in this case a hashtag is used within a body of text. The resulting output should be an integer of the total count. The body of text could be of any length, and only the whole word should be count. for example when searchin/counting "the", "bathe" should not be counted. Ideally an argument would be provided that indicates the text file and word to be used by the script.

### Notes:
