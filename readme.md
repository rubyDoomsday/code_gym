# Code Gym
I don't know about you but I suck at coding challenges. It's not that I can't do them. It's just that, as soon as I know someone is watching, I can't even type my name. I get embarassed and self conscience. Even the simplest task becomes super stressful when someone is looking over your shoulder.

Take into account that you are most likely not working in your favorite editor \*cough* vim \*cough*. In addition time constraints, I may or may not have access to my crib sheet of commonly used but often forgotten methods (I often can't tell you an answer off the top of my head but I can point to the exact page I wrote it down in my notes... I take a lot of notes!). Through in different coding languages and yada, yada, yadaâ€¦ ultimately I look like an idiot because I forgot to carry the 1.

As such I am compiling code challenges along with there solutions. Anytime I get hung up on a difficult problem I come here and knock out something simple. It's a confidence boost and it's good exercise. Hence, the code gym.
