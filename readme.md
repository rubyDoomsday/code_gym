# Code Gym
I don't know about you but I suck at doing coding challenges. Even the simplest task because super stressful when someone is looking over your shoulder. Take into account that you most likely not working in your favorite editor \*cough* vim \*cough* and your are under some time constraints, yada, yada, yada and you look like an idiot.

As such I am compiling code challenges that I have done along with their answers such that perhaps you will see this here and know in your heart of hearts that it is not you, it's me.

## Find the First X prime numbers
### Optimus Prime
Prime numbers: A prime number is a whole number greater than 1, whose only two whole-number factors are 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.

*scenario* in 15-20 minutes write a stand alone script that will produce the first `x` prime numbers. This can be printed out one at a time or as a single set.

#### Solution: `prime.rb`
